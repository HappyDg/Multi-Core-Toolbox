/*
 * SPSC_QUEUE: 
 * ==========
 * Single Producer, Single Consumer lockless queue.
 * 
 * What's special? 
 * ---------------
 * Producer and consumer can concurrently/parallely work 
 * on the queue without protection by locks.
 * 
 * If you have multiple producers and consumers, turn to 
 * MPSC_QUEUE in the same project.
 * 
 *
 * Implementation options and concerns
 * -----------------------------------
 * 1) spscq_node could be embeded in user defined strutures
 * 2) spscq_node could contain a pointer to user structures
 * The choice have impact to performance and limitations
 * Option 1 have better performance due to less malloc blocks
 * (less calls to memory allocation routines which is expensive)
 * and less pointer dereference(better cache usage).
 * Option 1 have limitation to free the killed dead node when 
 * you have multiple consumers protected by external locks. 
 * Because the user structure may still be in use by other 
 * consumer. With option 2, this is not a problem because the 
 * node does not contain user structure directly and could be 
 * freed without destroy user structure in use.
 * 
 * So it's designed to only for single-producer-single-consumer
 * scenario. If you have single-producer-multiple-consumer or
 * multiple-producer-multiple-consumer, you should use mpmc_queue
 * which is also shipped in this MCT project. And of cause option
 * 2 is taken by mpmc_queue.
 *
 * Another concern is dynamic memory management. All such staff 
 * is stripped out from my implementation. So there's no dependency
 * on specific memory management mechanism and flexable for any 
 * customized memory management algorithm and API. That's why the 
 * "node_to_free" pointer is exposed to user, other than freed 
 * inside the dequeue function.
